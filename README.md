# Boilerplate Express application

Just clone this repository and have an app -ready to use and extend- in seconds.
This is a very basic setup and it's intended for making the initial application architecture process much
faster.

Once you have cloned this repository, install the required packages:

```
npm install
```

Make a copy of `.env.sample` and name it `.env` and fill in the required values.

Run your application with either

```
node app/
```

or

```
grunt nodemon
```

All set and ready to go.

Visit: http://localhost:9000 (Unless you changed the port number in your `.env` file)

`Enjoy!`
