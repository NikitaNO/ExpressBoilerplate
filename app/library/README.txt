 Libraries should go here.
 -------------------------

 As we all know, the definition of library can be quite broad, especially among developers. Every body has a certain
 way of doing things, none of them is right, none of them is wrong.

 I like to think of a libraries as files that are used in multiple locations throughout the application and have
 no direct dependency. Just use them as needed.
