 Libraries should go here.
 -------------------------

 As we all know, the definition of library can be quite broad, especially among developers. Everybody has their own
 particular way of doing things, none of them is right, none of them is wrong.

 I like to think of 'libraries' as something that is used in multiple locations throughout the application and have
 no direct dependency. Just use them as needed.
